# Lip Sync / Sign Interpreter🎙️🤖

Welcome to the Lip Reading Model repository! This project aims to develop a machine learning model for lip reading, enhancing accessibility and societal benefits. By leveraging technologies such as TensorFlow 🧠, OpenCV 🎥, and Streamlit 📊, the model transcribes spoken words from lip movements captured in videos.

## Overview 📋

The project starts with client conversations 🗣️ to understand the significance of lip reading for accessibility. Upon agreement to proceed, dependencies are installed 📦, and the data pipeline is established 🚀. This includes data loading, preprocessing, and visualization, followed by neural network design and model training initiation 🏋️‍♂️.

## Usage 🚀

To use the lip reading model, follow the provided instructions to set up the project environment and structure 🛠️. Through a Streamlit application, users can upload videos for transcription, with the model providing predictions on the spoken words depicted in the videos 🎬. Detailed usage instructions are available in the README.

## Future Development 🔮

While the current implementation showcases the model's efficacy, there's room for further development. Future extensions may include integrating the model into full-stack applications for real-world deployment, refining prediction accuracy, and exploring alternative architectures or training methodologies.

For detailed instructions and code implementation, please refer to the project repository. Contributions, feedback, and collaborations are welcome to further advance the lip reading model's capabilities and practical applications 🌟.
