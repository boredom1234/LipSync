    1. Clone the repository:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/boredom1234/lipsync.git
       ```

    2. Install dependencies:
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

    st.markdown("## Usage")

    st.write("""
    1. Run the ```ipynb``` file to generate the model.
    2. If you don't have a GPU to support the hardware capabilities then you can use the pre-trained model. You can download it from the cell in the notebook. 
   [```96 epochs model has the best accuracy.```]
    1. Run the Streamlit app:
       ```bash
       streamlit run _main.py
       ```

    2. Follow the instructions in the app to:
       - Select the input sourcefrom the dataset.
       - Begin lip movement analysis and view predicted text.
