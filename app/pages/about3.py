#     Sign Language is the language of communication used by the deaf community. 
#     With advancements in image recognition technology, many studies have focused on 
#     sign language recognition using cameras. This project aims to use artificial neural networks 
#     for real-time sign language recognition in digital environments.

#     st.markdown("### Dataset")
#     st.write("""
#     The Sign Language Gesture Images Dataset was used for training the model. 
#     It contained 37 categories with 1,500 images each, consisting of numbers 0 through 9, 
#     all 26 alphabets, and the space sign. The model was trained only for characters, 
#     excluding the numbers and the letters J and Z. A 'Nothing' category was added to the 
#     dataset, resulting in 25 different classes.
